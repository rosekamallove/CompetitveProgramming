This repo contains my problem solving programs and notes. The `index.md` contains the notes for the Striver's SDE Sheet along with some problems that I did while solving that sheet.

### Building Intuition for Problem Solving

-   **Step 1: Self Assessment**
-   **Step 2: Review Data Structures & Algorithms**
-   **Step 3: Create a consistent system to track progress**
    -   Todo: New problems that you have not yet worked on
    -   Repeat: Problems that you have worked on but are still making some mistakes on
    -   Done: Problems that you have nailed and are confident about.
    -   Time yourself.
    -   Do 5 questions back to back (improve endurance)
    -   Score Yourself
        -   Did you need hints?
        -   Did you finish within 30 minutes
        -   Was the solution optimal
        -   Were there any bugs?
    -   Select Problems
-   **Step 4: Practice using spaced repetition**
-   **Step 5: Recognize common problem-solving patterns**
-   **Step 6: Evaluation of readiness**
-   **Step 7: Metacognition**
